# filespresent

A quick utility to scan a csv file and check if the files mentioned in that csv
are present. The idea is that you have a spreadsheet that gives a filename for
a receipt in each row. This utility checks your "receipt filename" column against
a directory of your choosing to list any receipts that are missing.
